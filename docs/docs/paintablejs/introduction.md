## What is Paintablejs?

PaintableJs is a library that lets you draw on a canvas with various options and methods.  
You can lay it over your application and draw on any screen, save the results, reload the drawn image, change color and width, use an eraser, undo and redo the latest drawings and [much more](../getting-started/props).  
It works with touch **and** mouse events.

## Demo

You can find a live Demo [here](https://festive-swanson-8786a6.netlify.app/).
